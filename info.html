<p> Green power is still a fairly new phenomenon in the grand scheme of things, however we at Rolsa want to assure our
    customers that this tech is nothing to be scared of! Our products are designed for efficiency and peace of mind, and also
    for saving you money, like our smart meters and solar panels to help keep energy costs low. If our buy-in cost for our carbon-friendly
    tech is a little out of your budget for the moment, don't fret! We understand the times are difficult for money, so we've come up with a few
    tips to help reduce your carbon footprint.
<br>
    <br>
    1. Try to avoid plastic, or recycle. We understand that this is a pretty hefty task nowadays, but the payoff is well worth it!
    micro and macroplastics are often harmful to wildlife, as many know, however what you may not know is that much more things are recycleable than
    you'd think. Check with your local council for the full scoop
<br>
    <br>
    2. Use more blankets and clothes instead of heating. A lot of people have become dependent on heating in the colder months, which works
    for some, however for the more carbon-conscious it's more beneficial to keep windows closed, and stock up on thick, warm clothes and blankets to stay warm
    Overall, we find it much more cozy anyway!
<br>
    <br>
    3. Try to walk, or cycle to more places. It's well-known now that combustion-engine cars are harmful to the environment, but the best option for those who don't
    have one is to walk, or use a bicycle for shorter commutes. They're cheap, carbon-efficient, and are scientifically proven to be beneficial to your mental wellbeing. Two birds with one stone!
